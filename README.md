We implement the Single Agent Navigation function in Proj1-ui folder. By clicking the left left mouse button, the obsticles shall be established at the position where the mouse position is. When pressing the space key, the nodes are established with the neighbor lines connect with each other. When clicking the right mouse button, the start position shall be at where the mouse is(the blue triangle), and the goal position shall be randomized on the graph(the red circle). THe triangle shall navigate its path and goes to the goal position.

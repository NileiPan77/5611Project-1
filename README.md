#### Feature Implemented

##### Par2

- Single Agent Navigation <br />

We implement the Single Agent Navigation function in Proj1-ui folder. By clicking the left left mouse button, the obsticles shall be established at the position where the mouse position is. When pressing the space key, the nodes are established with the neighbor lines connect with each other. When clicking the right mouse button, the start position shall be at where the mouse is(the blue triangle), and the goal position shall be randomized on the graph(the red circle). THe triangle shall navigate its path and goes to the goal position. <br />
- 3D Rendering & Camera <br />

We implement the 3D Rendering & Camera in Proj1-3D folder. The stars can plan their own path, go through the trees and reach the crown goal position. <br />
- Improved Agent & Scene Rendering <br />
We implement the 3D Rendering & Camera in Proj1-3D folder. The shown video is the same as 3D Rendering & Camera's video. We use the complex shapes (star represents the agent and crown represents the goalposition). <br />
- Orientation Smoothing <br />
- ![Multiple Agents Movement](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57411086/193342509-7853a701-a474-4465-aa8b-994bf30f2b56.gif) <br />
We implement the Single Agent Navigation function in Proj1-ui folder. We use the triangles that represents the agents, and one of their angles always point towards to the directions. If the agents and goals can not generate straight lines, the triangles will rotatie based on thieir direction motions.
- User Scenario Editing
- Multiple Agents Planning

##### Part 3

- TTC collision avoidance
